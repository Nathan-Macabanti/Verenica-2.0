Well hello cutiepoo
I see you don't know what to do
Why not listen over here
As I tell you how to move

I should tell you quick that there are notes that you pro'bly shouldn't touch
Unless you really into that just maybe don't get hit as much
So if you aren't then I say you zoom  out of the way
Avoid things that are red so you may fight another day

It's really easy you just press the button of the lane of want
Now for a demonstration alright show me whatchu got

3,2,1,GO
 
If you want to live then slide to the left
If you want to live then slide to the right
You wanna die then go back to center
Did my wordplay get you there ok then let try to get better

If you don't wanna live then back to the left
If you don't wanna die then back to the right
I forgot to mention press up to jump in the stratosphere
Well way to go you lived I see you learned a lesson here

Lastly you better go jump //When the Jump Notes are implemented

--BREAK--

Wow your doing good but now time to smack
When the note is green you gotta hit it back
You can touch these notes as much as you need
Unless your not into that then hey that's I guess that's good for me

Ok enough talk demonstration time. Remember hit these back

Now come and let us try to apply what you learn
Alright come at me I'll teach you a lesson nerd
